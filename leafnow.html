        <h1><u>THE GREEN INITIATIVE</u></h1>

        <h2><u>WHAT IS GREEN INITIATIVE?</u></h2>
        <p>More than 1.2 billion jobs depend on a stable environment and ecosystems. The Green Initiative aims to scale up the  knowledge, policy response and capacity to manage a just transition toward greener economies and a sustainable future.<br>
            The Green Initiative focuses on three areas of critical importance:<br>
           1) Advance research and understanding of the challenges and opportunities for the world of work arising from a green transition.<br>
           2) Forge policy responses from the world of work in all sectors to ensure decent work and social justice for all.<br>
           3) Build strategic partnerships at national, regional and international levels.</p>
        <h3><u>CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF A GREEN TRANSITION</u></h3>
        <p>The Green Initiative seeks to better equip the world of work to understand the challenges and opportunities of the coming transition, and help them take up the active role that they must play in managing this change. It provides a platform of knowledge and research to further build the case that decent work approaches and social dialogue are indispensable for truly transformative change.<br>
            The ILO will continue strengthening its role as a unique policy reference on employment, social protection, equality and social dialogue, while linking them to thematic issues on climate change, low-carbon and resource efficient innovative strategies. The connections highlighted between such sectors give the opportunity to expand research and analysis on front line issues, complex interactions and consequences of environmental change for the future of work
        </p>
        <h3><u>GREEN INITIATIVES ADVANTAGES</u></h3>
        <p>The benefits of going green are many. Not only can you help the environment, but green initiatives are advantageous for the economy, general health, and more.<br>
            Economic Benefits
            People tend to associate going green with increased financial costs, and while there may be upfront costs, the reality is that in the long term money will be saved. Renewable energy sources reduce energy consumption and lower electricity bills. Some states even offer incentives to those who create green homes and buildings. Green initiatives are also creating new employment opportunities.<br>
            
            Essentially, a green initiative can cut costs.<br>
            
            <h4><u>Health Benefits</u></h4>
            <p>The prioritization of going green results in the reduction of air pollutants and environmental toxins, which means cleaner air for breathing. The World Health Organization (WHO) revealed a study that showed that air pollution causes approximately 2 million premature deaths every year throughout the world. A healthy person is a productive person.<br>
            
            The health of our environment affects human health.<br></p>
            
            <h4><u>Environmental Benefits</u></h4>
            <p> environment benefits when people make choices that encourage things such as organic farming, responsible land use, and habitat preservation. For example, organic farming reduces greenhouse gas emissions and lowers air pollution. Tree conservation means better air quality.<br>
            
            A healthy environment means a more sustainable future.<br></p>
            
            <h4><u>Legal and Tax Benefits</u></h4>
            <p>Some states are beginning to regulate energy use and emission waste. Businesses must follow suit and incorporate green technology into their daily tasks. For example, Florida allows businesses to produce and sell electricity from renewable energy sources for a corporate income tax credit. On the federal level, the IRS offers businesses with hybrid company cars to take an alternative motor vehicle credit on federal taxes. The federal government also allows companies to receive a tax credit of up to 30 percent for the use of solar and wind energy.<br></p>
            
            <h4><u>Brand Benefits</u></h4>
            <p>There is something to be said for crafting a brand that is known for environmental stewardship by actively taking steps that prioritize the health of the planet. Consumers are always going to buy products, but thereâ€™s the corresponding emotional benefit of knowing that a purchase was also good for the environment. Businesses that have switched to green initiatives are seeing positive responses from consumers.<br>
            
            The importance of green initiative means being a good steward of the environment while also meeting your business goals. Both can be done.
